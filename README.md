# ðŸ§  Memory Forge

**Memory Forge** is a desktop application that converts raw `.txt` or `.mp3` files into structured memory chunks for use in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) workflows.

Built with Electron + Python + Whisper + OpenAI.

##  Features

-  Process `.txt` and transcribe `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.ogg`, `.m4a` audio files
-  Automatically punctuates and formats transcripts with OpenAI
-  Outputs:
  - **RAG Memory**: title, content, and auto-tagged topics
  - **SFT Data**: instruction-response pairs
-  Save output as `.jsonl`
-  Customize default open/save directories
-  Works entirely offline for Whisper (OpenAI required for punctuation only)
