We do not have true democracy in this country, the United States of America. We have what's really more akin to a fucking oligarchy. And you know, actually speaking of that, Princeton University did a study that took a look at which piece of legislation would go on to become an actual law, and like why, you know, what were the factors behind that. They found that money was the single most important factor determining whether legislation became law, not public support or you know, what people actually wanted. It was basically saying special interest groups and lobbyists have totally corrupted this political system in this country. It's so fucked. So you know, I think Republicans, Democrats, they're birds of a feather, you know what I mean? They're the same fucking thing. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the war machine keeps on spinning. That's how I fucking see it.", "tags": []}
